The Vector Neural Network and "Fool the Robot" Game

Description:

This project creates a human understandable layer that feeds a trace of MNIST handwritten digits 
into a fully connected Neural Network in order to test its performance, interpretability and flexibility.

The vector layer also powers a "Fool the Robot" game where the users goal is to create digits that are 
recognizable to users, but can "fool the AI" into thinking they are different numbers.

How to run the project:

Put the following 8 files and 1 directory into whatever directory you'd like to run the program from:

cmu_112_graphics.py
vectorizer.py
vnn_fileParser.py
vnn_TF.py
mnist_standard_testing.csv
mnist_standard_training.csv
mnist_VNN_testing.csv
mnist_VNN_training.csv
imageFiles

in the imageFiles directory, place all the included image files

Libraries Needed to run the application:

PIL
tensorflow
pandas

There are no shortcut commands in the program, other than those explicitly shown in the on screen instructions
